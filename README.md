# Welcome to a Day in the Life of a UX Engineer
This project was created to give potential candidates a good sense for the kind of work we do on the platform UX engineering side of Service Now. This codebase represents a simple shopping cart application, built using the same technologies and architecture we use in production. These include ES6, Web Components, React, Webpack, Sass, etc. However, the code is not without problems. We have introduces some bugs and remove some functionality to better simulate the day to day interaction we have with the code and through it show engineers different strategies and concepts we use. 

Check out the issues tab in the repo for hints of some of the issues with this code base as well as some desired features.

If you feel comfortable with this type of work and would like to apply, we would love to have you. Check out our career site here: [https://www.servicenow.com/company/careers/join-servicenow.html](https://www.servicenow.com/company/careers/join-servicenow.html)
